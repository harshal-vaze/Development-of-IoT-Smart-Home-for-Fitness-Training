*Project Description*

In this project a Java Web-Application was built to simulate the working of IoT environment in Fitness. It comprises of IoT Gateway, IoT Devices (Sensors and Actuators) and Web platform. IoT Gateway handles the requests and responses from IoT devices using CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) and from Web application using HTTP protocol, different protocols are utilized for communication between different interfaces with different data encoding schemes (XML and JSON). Technologies used are HTTP and CoAP protocols, JSON and XML encoding schemes, Java Spring-Boot framework, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
